# Users

### Instructions
`yarn start`- to run the app
`yarn test` - to run test

### Areas of improvement
* Implement caching so when moving between routes it doesn't cause fetching of the same users again
* Join `useGetAllUser`s and `useSearch` users into one declarative custom hook
* Write more tests
